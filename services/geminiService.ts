    **Composition Mandate (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
    - **Framing:** The photograph MUST be a **${shotTypeDescription}**. This is a strict compositional requirement.

  **Overall Style Mandate (CRITICAL):** The entire photograph must adhere to a '${overallStyle}' aesthetic. This choice influences everything from the architecture and furniture to the fashion and mood.

  **Cultural Context Adaptation (CRITICAL - HIGHEST PRIORITY):**
  - **Country:** ${country}
  - **Instruction:** This is the most important rule. You MUST interpret and adapt ALL other instructions to be authentic and culturally appropriate for ${country}.
    - **For the subject (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** The generated person's ethnicity and physical features (face, skin, hair, eyes) MUST be 100% representative of a person from **${country}**.
        - **Ethnic Feature Guide (ABSOLUTE RULE):** To achieve this, you MUST strictly follow this guide for authentic facial features: **"${ethnicFeaturesGuide}"**. This guide is the final authority on the subject's appearance.
        - **Diversity Mandate:** Avoid stereotypical representations. For every new generation, create a completely unique individual with distinct facial features consistent with the guide. Do not reuse faces.
        - **Conflict Resolution:** If the "Subject Details" below (like description or tones) conflict with the Ethnic Feature Guide, you MUST **IGNORE** the conflicting details and prioritize the guide. This is the absolute final authority.
    - **For the location:** If a specific style mentioned in the 'Environmental Context' (e.g., 'Scandinavian kitchen') conflicts with the country context (${country}), you MUST creatively merge the two concepts. The core cultural identity of the location MUST be ${country}, with the specified style being an influence. For example, for a 'Scandinavian kitchen' in 'Japan', the result should be a Japanese home that incorporates Scandinavian design principles (minimalism, natural wood, functionality), not a Scandinavian home randomly placed in Japan. Always prioritize the authenticity of the ${country} context.

  **Composition Mandate (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
  - **Framing:** The photograph MUST be a **${shotTypeDescription}**. This is a strict compositional requirement.

  **CRITICAL Prohibition:**
  - **NO Artificial Framing:** The generated image must NOT have any artificial borders, black frames, vignettes, or any visual effect that suggests a digital frame has been added. The image content must extend to the very edge.
  - **NO CGI/3D Look:** Aggressively avoid any trace of CGI, 3D rendering, video game graphics, or digital artificiality. If a surface looks like plastic or unnaturally smooth, the generation has failed.
  - **NO Stock Photo Vibe:** Avoid sterile, perfectly staged, or overly clean environments. The scene must feel lived-in and natural.

  **Subject Details (Guideline Only, overruled by Ethnic Guide):**
  - **Individual:** A ${modelData.age}-year-old ${modelData.gender} model.
  - **Pose (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** The subject MUST be in the following pose: **${modelData.pose}**.
  - **Physicality:** ${modelData.description}. The subject has a **${modelData.bodyShape}** body shape.
  - **Color Tones (Hair, Eyes, Skin):** ${modelData.tones}.
  - **Expression:** A natural, candid ${modelData.expression}. Capture an authentic, unposed moment.
  - **Outfit:** ${modelData.outfit}. Clothing must have realistic weight, creases, and texture. ${outfitColorDirective}

  **Environmental Context:**
  - **Location:** ${sceneData.location}.
  - **Atmosphere:** A palpable ${sceneData.mood} mood.
  - **Scene Details:** ${sceneData.details}.

  **Mandatory Photographic & Realism Engine:**
  - **Camera & Lens Emulation:** Strictly emulate a **Fujifilm X-T4 with a Fujinon 35mm f/1.4 lens**.
  - **Color & Film Science:** Adhere strictly to the **Fujifilm "Classic Chrome" film simulation**. This means muted, cinematic tones with high color fidelity and a subtle, organic film grain (NOT digital noise).
  - **Lighting Physics:** ${sceneData.lighting}. The lighting must be physically accurate. Demonstrate a deep understanding of how light behaves in the real world: how it wraps around forms, creates soft penumbras, bounces off surfaces to create subtle fill light, and how different color temperatures (e.g., cool window light, warm lamp light) mix realistically.
  - **Lived-In Reality Principle:** This is the highest priority. The scene must feel real and occupied.
    - **Physical Coherence:** All elements must obey the laws of physics. Shadows must be cast from a consistent light source. Reflections in surfaces (glass, metal) must accurately mirror the environment. Objects must show the effect of gravity.
    - **Micro-Imperfections:** Introduce subtle, logical signs of life. A faint coffee cup ring on a a table, almost invisible micro-scratches on a phone screen, a book spine that's slightly creased, dust motes dancing in a sunbeam. These details should be barely noticeable but contribute to the overall authenticity.
    - **Texture Fidelity:** All surfaces must possess high-fidelity, tangible textures. Wood shows grain and pores, fabric has a visible weave, skin reveals natural micro-texture.

  **Reference Photo Instructions (If Provided):**
  ${referenceData.usePhoto && referenceData.photo ? `
    An image is provided as a reference. Adhere to these rules:
    - Style: ${referenceData.useStyle ? 'Strongly match the artistic style, color grading, and aesthetic of the reference.' : 'Ignore the style of the reference.'}

  Your response MUST be a JSON object containing keys for ONLY these fields.

  **CRITICAL RULES for generating new values:**
  1.  **RADICAL DIVERGENCE:** The new values MUST be a massive creative leap from the current values. Subtle changes are a failure. Think "completely different photoshoot".
  2.  **AVOID CLICHÉS:** Actively reject the most common or stereotypical ideas associated with the context (${country}, ${overallStyle}). Find a unique, unexpected angle.
  3.  **CULTURAL & CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS:** All generated values must be authentic and appropriate for the given context (${country}, ${overallStyle}, ${modelType}, etc.).
  4.  **ETHNIC FEATURES (If 'description' or 'tones' are requested):** You MUST strictly adhere to this guide for authentic features: **"${ethnicFeaturesGuide}"**. Create a specific individual, do not repeat the guide.
  5.  **BODY SHAPE (If requested):** The body shape must be realistic and consistent with the overall description.
  6.  **OUTFIT (If requested):** The outfit MUST strictly match the '${outfitStyle}' style. It must also be culturally appropriate for ${country}. To ensure this, create a new, unique outfit description inspired by the following examples for a '${outfitStyle}' look, but DO NOT copy them directly: ${JSON.stringify(outfitExamples)}.
  7.  **OUTFIT COLOR (If requested):** Generate a creative and suitable color for the described outfit. It can be a simple color ('red') or more descriptive ('sky blue').
  8.  **POSE (If requested):** The pose must match the model persona (${modelType}) and sensuality (${currentModel.isSensual}).
  9.  **SCENE (If requested):** Scene elements must feel like a real, mundane, and culturally authentic place in ${country}. Avoid idealized or generic descriptions. ${sceneInstruction}
